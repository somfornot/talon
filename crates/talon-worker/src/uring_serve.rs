//! Thread-per-core io_uring data-plane runtime (#285).
//!
//! monoio has no work-stealing scheduler. It scales by running N independent
//! single-threaded runtimes — one per core — that share nothing. This module
//! provides that shape for the worker's data plane:
//!
//! - **one ring per thread**, each pinned to a core with `bind_to_cpu_set`, so
//!   a connection's protocol scheduling never migrates between cores;
//! - **`SO_REUSEPORT`**, so every ring binds the same listen address and the
//!   *kernel* distributes accepts by 4-tuple hash. There is no shared accept
//!   queue and no thundering herd;
//! - **a per-ring blocking pool**, because the zero-copy `sendfile`/`splice`
//!   syscalls are blocking and must never run on a ring (a slow client would
//!   otherwise stall every connection that ring owns).
//!
//! Measured at 8.05x scaling on 8 rings, with per-core throughput flat from 1
//! to 16 rings — i.e. no cross-ring contention (#273).
//!
//! # What is *not* sharded
//!
//! Shared worker state stays shared. Benchmarks showed that sharding
//! `BlockIndex` per ring costs 30-67% in cross-ring forwarding (connections are
//! distributed by TCP 4-tuple, blocks by `block_id`, so ~1/N of requests land
//! on the owning ring), and that per-shard eviction budgets waste capacity —
//! with 256 MiB blocks over 64 GiB there are only ~256 slots, far too few for
//! hash uniformity. So each ring holds an `Arc` of the same `WorkerRuntime`.
//! That is sound: `!Send` constrains *futures crossing threads*, not shared
//! state read from within a ring.
