//! The backend (origin) store abstraction.

//! [`BackendStore`] is the durable source a worker fetches from on a cache miss:
//! S3, GCS, or Azure Blob. It is deliberately separate from
//! [`ObjectStore`](crate::ObjectStore) (the local cache): different lifecycle,
//! different failure modes, and it is driven off the data-plane ring by the
//! loader thread pool (see `DESIGN.md`).
