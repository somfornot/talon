# Benchmarks

Talon uses [Divan](https://docs.rs/divan) microbenchmarks plus a thin harness
(`scripts/bench.py`) that turns Divan's human-only table into structured JSON and
diffs a run against a committed baseline. The goal is a fast, machine-readable
performance signal so that changes — whether made by a human or a coding agent —
get timely feedback.

## Quick start

```sh
just bench            # run all benches, write bench/results/latest.json
just bench-save main  # promote the latest run to the committed baseline
just bench-check      # run + diff vs baseline; non-zero exit on regression
```

Scope a run to one crate to iterate faster:

```sh
just bench -p talon-core
just bench-check -p talon-coordinator --threshold 15
```

## The workflow

1. **Establish a baseline.** On a known-good commit: `just bench && just bench-save main`.
   `bench/baselines/main.json` is committed and is the reference everything
   compares against.
2. **Iterate.** After a change, `just bench-check`. It prints a markdown table
   (`benchmark | baseline | current | Δ | verdict`) and exits non-zero if any
   benchmark regresses beyond the threshold (default ±10%, above typical
   microbench noise). Use `--soft` to report without failing.
3. **Intentional perf change?** Re-run `just bench-save main` to move the
   baseline, and commit it in the same PR so the diff is reviewable.

## What is measured

Deterministic, CPU-bound hot paths (low variance, good for regression
detection):

- `talon-core` (`core_benches`): key path ↔ id conversion, `PresentBitmap`
  operations, `BlockId::page_count`.
- `talon-coordinator` (`placement_benches`): `RendezvousPlacement::locate`
  across 8/64/256 nodes — the per-request placement lookup.

The zero-copy data plane (`sendfile`/`splice`) is I/O-bound and higher-variance;
those benches are added in a separate tier when the transport layer lands.

- `talon-worker` (`dataplane_benches`): the Tokio and io_uring data planes
  serving the same resident block over real loopback TCP (#285).

  **Read this one with care.** It drives a single client serially, so it
  measures a per-request latency floor, not scaling. At concurrency 1 the two
  planes are statistically indistinguishable — across seven runs the medians
  overlapped and the sign of the difference flipped run to run. That is
  expected: io_uring amortizes syscalls across many in-flight operations, and
  with one request in flight there is nothing to amortize, while the bulk bytes
  bypass the ring via `sendfile` on both paths. The 35% win measured in #273 was
  at 1024 concurrent connections.

  A Divan harness cannot model that concurrency honestly — a synthetic fan-out
  inside `bench()` would mostly measure the harness's own scheduling. So this
  bench is a **regression floor**, not the evidence for how the planes compare
  under load. That question is answered by the load test below.

## Concurrent load test

`scripts/dataplane_loadtest.sh` drives a real worker with many connections in
flight and reports the latency distribution. This is the measurement Divan
cannot make, and the evidence behind the io_uring default.

```sh
scripts/dataplane_loadtest.sh                        # sweep 1/64/256/1024
CONNS=1,512 SECONDS_PER=30 scripts/dataplane_loadtest.sh
```

It starts a coordinator, a local blob origin, and a worker on each data plane in
turn, then sweeps connection counts against each. Results on a 16-core EPYC
7763, 64 KiB ranges, 10 s measured after a 3 s warmup:

| conns | io_uring rps | tokio rps | io_uring p50 | tokio p50 | io_uring p99 | tokio p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5,636 | 4,837 | 161 µs | 191 µs | 259 µs | 293 µs |
| 64 | 54,755 | 55,191 | 900 µs | 1,057 µs | 5,371 µs | 2,853 µs |
| 256 | 42,417 | 56,999 | 1,243 µs | 3,835 µs | 7,423 µs | 10,283 µs |
| **1024** | **51,668** | 41,060 | **1,175 µs** | 19,905 µs | **4,781 µs** | 72,911 µs |

At 1024 connections io_uring delivers **26% more throughput at 17× lower p50 and
15× lower p99**, using comparable CPU and 19% less memory.

**The middle of the sweep is not monotonic, and that is worth knowing.** At 64
and 256 connections Tokio sometimes wins — work-stealing balances a moderate
load well, while rings can sit idle. The advantage becomes decisive at high
connection counts, which is the regime a cache fleet actually runs in. Do not
read a single row as the whole picture.

Notes on running it:

- **Manual, not CI.** Shared runners are too noisy for absolute-time
  comparison, the same reason the bench job is informational.
- **Percentiles, not means.** The difference lives in the tail; a mean hides it.
- **Warmup is excluded** from recorded samples, so the numbers describe the
  serve path rather than the first-fetch miss path.
- **`talon-loadgen` can drive an existing worker** directly:
  `talon-loadgen --addr host:7001 --backend s3 --conns 1024 --server-pid <pid>`.
  Set `--backend` to the backend configured on the target worker (the default is
  `az`). With `--server-pid` it samples the worker's CPU and RSS from `/proc`
  across the measured window; `--json` emits JSON Lines for scripted comparison.
- A run that reports **no samples** is a failed run, not a fast one — the tool
  refuses to turn error frames into latency numbers and prints the first error
  verbatim.

## Native-client path load test

`just client-path-bench` measures a different boundary from `talon-loadgen`.
It drives the real Rust `Client`, including lazy block planning, exact-version
requests, client-side placement, connection pooling, retries, and forced
membership refresh. Protocol-compatible loopback coordinator and worker peers
provide controlled response latency and failures:

```sh
# Independent logical reads: find the application-concurrency knee.
just client-path-bench --seconds 10 --scenario steady,failure,membership \
  --delay-us 1000,5000 --concurrency 1,8,32,64,128,256,512

# One large logical read: isolate the per-read block window.
just client-path-bench --seconds 10 --scenario steady --concurrency 1 \
  --blocks-per-read 256 --block-concurrency 8,32,64,96,128,256

# Verify aggregate backpressure or produce machine-readable results.
just client-path-bench --concurrency 512 --max-in-flight 64 --json
```

The axes are intentionally separate:

- `--concurrency` is the number of independent logical `Client::read_into`
  calls. This is the important axis for application QPS.
- `--block-concurrency` bounds block requests from **one** logical read. It is a
  fairness window, not a process-wide request cap.
- `--max-in-flight` is the aggregate block-request budget shared by a `Client`
  and all its clones. It bounds socket and worker pressure across callers.
- `failure` returns a typed, retryable `Unavailable` every
  `--failure-every` worker attempts. `membership` alternates between two
  workers every `--membership-switch-ms`, making the cached owner stale.

The terminal table summarizes successful logical QPS, worker-attempt QPS
(including retries), latency, logical errors, failure/refresh counts, and peak
worker requests. `--json` additionally records the full workload configuration,
p95/max latency, membership switches, new connections, byte counts, and raw
counters.
The benchmark passes a known `(size, version)` to every read, matching callers
that reuse a preceding stat and keeping per-read metadata RPCs out of the data
path measurement.

### Directional results and selected defaults

One release build on a 64-logical-CPU Intel Xeon Gold 6338 host, with 4 KiB
single-block reads, a 4,096-block working set, 1 ms injected service delay, and
2 s measured after 1 s warmup produced:

| logical concurrency | successful reads/s | p99 |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 32 | 10,972 | 3.51 ms |
| 128 | 39,786 | 4.66 ms |
| 512 | 94,283 | 7.93 ms |
| 1,024 | 95,665 | 17.85 ms |
| 2,048 | 95,117 | 28.55 ms |

The client passes 10K QPS at 32 independent reads and plateaus between 512 and
1,024 on this host. More callers above that point add queueing, not throughput.
A control run with 512 callers and `--max-in-flight 64` observed exactly 64
peak worker requests and 20,993 reads/s, confirming that the aggregate limiter
rather than the caller count controls resource use.

At 5 ms injected service delay and 256 independent reads, the fault scenarios
retained nearly all steady-state throughput:

| scenario | successful reads/s | p99 | logical errors | membership queries | worker failures |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| steady | 34,569 | 9.15 ms | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1% attempt failure | 33,835 | 11.26 ms | 4 | 36 | 691 injected |
| membership switch / 500 ms | 34,052 | 15.06 ms | 0 | 3 | 768 stale-owner |

The 1% injector operates per attempt, so a retry can independently be selected
for failure; those exhausted retries are reported as logical errors instead of
being hidden. The much smaller membership-query count demonstrates refresh
coalescing under a concurrent failure burst.

For a single 256-block logical read at 1 ms service delay, the per-read window
sweep was:

| block window | worker attempts/s | logical-read p99 | peak worker requests |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | 3,119 | 83.40 ms | 8 |
| 32 | 9,963 | 29.90 ms | 32 |
| **64** | **14,417** | **22.21 ms** | **64** |
| 96 | 15,694 | 19.96 ms | 96 |
| 128 | 16,146 | 20.16 ms | 128 |
| 256 | 15,449 | 23.44 ms | 154 |

Window 64 reaches 89% of the best measured block QPS with half the in-flight
work of window 128; window 256 adds no throughput and worsens the tail. This is
why the native client defaults to **64 per logical read** plus **1,024 across
the Client and its clones**. The Rust builder exposes both limits for workloads
with a different latency/resource trade-off.

The 4 KiB block size in the fan-out run is deliberate: it creates many block
requests without allocating a huge destination. Production C/Python defaults
use 256 MiB blocks, where 256 blocks would represent a 64 GiB read. And because
the synthetic worker writes bytes through userspace rather than using the real
worker's `sendfile` path, these figures are client-path comparisons, not worker
capacity claims. Pair them with `scripts/dataplane_loadtest.sh` for the real
worker ceiling.

## Object-store gateway

`just gateway-bench` measures the bounded HTTP runtime around controlled
cache-client, worker, and origin delays, then streams a large object to a slow
consumer while sampling RSS. Results and interpretation are in the
[gateway benchmark reference](docs/reference/object-store-gateway-benchmarks.md).
The harness emits JSON Lines and is a regression floor, not a cloud capacity
claim.

### S3 and Azure proxy paths, end to end

`just gateway-proxy-bench` drives the gateway's **real** adapters — a live
coordinator, worker, cache and origin — rather than the fixed sleeps above.
It exists to answer two questions the synthetic harness cannot: does either
client protocol cost more than the other, and what does the cache route buy
over passing through to origin?

Four deployments run concurrently on one 16-core host (S3 and Azure × `cache`
and `origin`), against one dual-protocol origin stub so both adapters face an
identical backend. Rounds are paired and **order-swapped**, so machine drift
lands on both arms instead of on whichever ran first. Every response is
verified against the origin by SHA-256; a wrong status, length, or checksum
fails the run rather than being counted as throughput.

| Arm | rps (median of 4) | MiB/s | p50 | p99 | CPU/req | cores busy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S3, `cache` | 3,080 | 3,080 | 1.64 ms | 3.64 ms | 840 µs | 2.98 |
| Azure, `cache` | 3,165 | 3,165 | 1.63 ms | 3.22 ms | 840 µs | 2.97 |
| S3, `origin` | 1,579 | 1,579 | 2.01 ms | 44.6 ms | 990 µs | 1.47 |
| Azure, `origin` | 1,638 | 1,638 | 1.95 ms | 45.0 ms | 975 µs | 1.72 |

1 MiB ranges, concurrency 8, 2,000 measured requests per arm per round, 64 MiB
object.

**The two protocols cost the same.** Azure leads S3 by 2.8% on the cache route,
but the run-to-run spread within a single arm is up to 4.0%, so that gap is
smaller than the noise it sits in. Per-request CPU is identical to three
significant figures (840 µs both). Treat S3 and Azure as equal-cost front
ends; there is no protocol-level reason to prefer one.

**The cache route is ~1.95× the origin route** and, more importantly, changes
the shape of the tail: p99 falls from ~45 ms to ~3.4 ms, a 13× improvement,
because a cache hit never inherits the origin's variance.

**Control, so the origin arms are not misread.** The same client straight to
the origin stub with the gateway removed reaches 4,014 rps. The origin arms
land near 40% of that, so they are measuring gateway passthrough cost, not the
stub's ceiling. They still hold the origin's latency distribution, which is why
their p99 is the stub's and not the gateway's.

**What this is not.** Loopback, one host, a synthetic origin: these are
*relative* numbers for comparing adapters and routes, not a cloud capacity
claim. Cross-node, the NIC binds long before any of these figures
([see below](#where-the-serve-path-actually-saturates)).

## Where the serve path actually saturates

The sweep above compares data planes against each other. It does not answer a
prior question: *what is the ceiling, and what is holding it?* These runs do.
They matter because an optimization that helps on loopback can be worth nothing
on a real cluster, where a different resource runs out first.

All numbers below: `talon-srv8` on a managed Kubernetes cluster
(`Standard_E64ads_v5` class node, worker capped at 8 CPU by its cgroup),
64 KiB ranges, all cache hits, 32 connections, 20 s measured after a 6 s
warmup, `talon-loadgen --depth 16`.

### Loopback: the kernel is the bottleneck, not Talon

Client and worker on the same node, over `127.0.0.1`:

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| throughput | 167,278 rps = **11.0 GB/s** (87.7 Gbps) |
| worker CPU | 5.78 of 8 cores |
| **kernel time** | **85% of worker CPU** (12,873 of 15,079 ticks) |
| user time | 15% (2,206 ticks) |

Tuning the ring count and connection count raises the peak further, on the same
8-core host, at depth 16 with 64 connections:

| rings | throughput | GB/s | worker CPU | kernel share |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 51,718 rps | 3.39 | 1.00 | 88% |
| 2 | 71,907 rps | 4.71 | 1.99 | 88% |
| 4 | 138,144 rps | 9.05 | 3.98 | 88% |
| **8** | **189,379 rps** | **12.41** | 5.71 | 89% |

189,379 rps reproduced within 1% across runs (187,553 on a repeat). Note that the
8-ring peak uses 5.71 of 8 cores: the system stops being CPU-bound before it runs
out of cores, because a single pipelined ring already spends 88% of its time in
the kernel and additional rings contend for one shared network stack.

![Throughput and CPU used across 1, 2, 4 and 8 io_uring rings](docs/assets/bench/ring-scaling.svg)

CPU was sampled from `utime`/`stime` in `/proc/<pid>/stat` across the measured
window. The split is the finding: **six sevenths of the worker's CPU is spent
inside the kernel** — `sendfile` copying bytes and the TCP stack — and only one
seventh in Talon's own code (frame decode, cache lookup, response assembly).

![Worker CPU split: 85% kernel time, 15% Talon's own code](docs/assets/bench/cpu-split.svg)

The practical consequence is that user-space optimizations on this path have a
small denominator. Halving *all* of Talon's user-space work on the serve path
would move total CPU by about 7%. Work that removes copies or syscalls
(zero-copy send, batched submission) acts on the 85%.

### Across the network: the NIC is the bottleneck, and it binds first

Same worker, driven from `talon-cli7-0` on a **different node**, over the pod
network:

| path | rps | GB/s | Gbps | p50 | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| loopback | 167,278 | 11.0 | 87.7 | 4,617 µs | 35,244 µs |
| **cross-node** | **44,662** | **2.93** | **23.4** | 20,269 µs | 49,905 µs |

Cross-node throughput is **27% of the loopback rate at the same 32 connections**
(24% of the 189,379 rps peak reached at 64 connections), and 23.4 Gbps against a
25 GbE link is the wire, saturated. On this cluster the NIC runs out well before
the worker does — the worker is not the constraint at all.

![Loopback vs cross-node throughput against the 25 GbE line rate](docs/assets/bench/throughput-ceilings.svg)

**Read the loopback number as a component ceiling, not a capacity claim.** It
measures how fast the serve path can go when the network is free. Any change
that moves the loopback number but not the cross-node number has not made the
deployed system faster.

### Pipelining: the one change that moved the network number

Depth is requests kept in flight per connection (`--depth`). Cross-node:

| depth | rps | GB/s | p50 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 22,315 | 1.46 | 762 µs |
| **16** | **44,592** | **2.92** | 20,250 µs |

Pipelining **doubles cross-node throughput**, because at depth 1 each connection
pays a full network round trip per request and the link sits idle waiting. It
buys throughput with latency: p50 rises 27×, as depth-16 queueing means a
request waits behind 15 others. That is the expected trade, not a defect —
depth 1 is latency-optimal, depth 16 is bandwidth-optimal.

### Multiplexing: measured, and not merged

Serving a connection's requests concurrently with out-of-order replies
(multiplexing, as opposed to in-order pipelining) was implemented and measured
against the same baseline. It did not pay:

| | baseline | multiplexed | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| loopback rps | 167,278 | 160,725 | **−3.9%** |
| loopback user ticks | 2,206 | 2,484 | **+12.6%** |
| loopback kernel ticks | 12,873 | 12,895 | +0.2% |
| loopback max latency | 51.7 ms | **5,111 ms** | 99× worse |
| cross-node rps | 44,662 | 44,612 | −0.1% |

The kernel time is unchanged — multiplexing does not remove a single copy or
syscall — while user time rises by an eighth for task spawning, semaphore
admission, and write-lock acquisition. Multiplexing exists to remove head-of-line
blocking, which requires *variance* in per-request service time; a uniform
all-cache-hit workload has none to remove, so only the overhead lands.

The max-latency blowup is structural and worth recording. Two responses' bytes
must never interleave on the wire, and `sendfile` cannot be paused mid-transfer,
so the write half must be held exclusively for the duration of each response.
Multiplexing therefore reintroduces at the writer exactly the serialization it
removes at the reader — and adds lock queueing on top.

Cross-node the two are indistinguishable, because there the NIC decides.

**Conclusion: not merged.** Multiplexing may still pay on a workload with genuine
service-time variance (mixed cache hits and origin misses on one connection),
which is the condition to test before revisiting it. It does not pay here.

### Method notes

- **Paired and order-swapped.** Baseline and candidate were run alternately, and
  the order reversed between rounds, so drift in the shared cluster cannot
  masquerade as an effect.
- **Baselines built from the exact parent commit**, not from a nearby branch.
  Comparing against a tree that already contains another change produces a
  confident and wrong number; this was caught happening.
- **The measurement client can be the bottleneck.** An earlier version of
  `talon-loadgen` matched pipelined replies positionally, which serialized its
  own reader and capped every depth-16 result near 85k rps — half the true
  figure. Numbers recorded before that fix understate the worker and should not
  be compared against numbers here. When a candidate and its baseline both sit
  at a suspiciously equal ceiling, suspect the harness.

## Charts

The figures above are generated, not hand-drawn. `bench/data/dataplane.json`
holds the measurements and is the single source of truth for both the charts and
the tables on this page; `scripts/bench_charts.py` renders it to SVG:

```sh
just bench-charts           # re-render docs/assets/bench/*.svg
just bench-charts --check   # non-zero exit if a chart is stale
```

Dependencies are declared inline (PEP 723), so `uv` builds a throwaway
environment on demand — there is nothing to install and matplotlib is not a
project dependency.

**To record a new measurement, edit the JSON and re-run — never edit an SVG.**
Keeping one source means a re-measurement cannot leave the charts saying one
thing and the prose another. Output is byte-reproducible (fixed `svg.hashsalt`,
no render timestamp), so an unchanged run produces no diff and `--check` is
meaningful. `--check` renders to a scratch directory rather than the committed
paths, so it reports drift instead of silently repairing it.

## For coding agents

- One command surface: `just bench`, `just bench-save`, `just bench-check`,
  `just bench-charts`.
- `bench-check` output is a markdown table and its exit code is the verdict
  (0 = within threshold, 1 = regression). Parse either.
- `bench/results/latest.json` and `bench/baselines/<name>.json` are stable
  `{ "binary::name[/arg]": median_ns }` maps for programmatic diffing.
- `bench/data/dataplane.json` is the structured record of the data-plane
  measurements — read numbers from there rather than parsing prose or SVGs.
- Prefer scoping with `-p <crate>` while iterating; run the full suite before
  saving a baseline.

## CI

The `bench` CI job runs `bench-check --soft` and posts the table to the job
summary. It is **informational only** (`continue-on-error`) — shared CI runners
are too noisy for absolute-time gating, so benchmarks never block a merge. The
committed baseline is the source of truth; refresh it deliberately.
