# Benchmarks

Talon uses [Divan](https://docs.rs/divan) microbenchmarks plus a thin harness
(`scripts/bench.py`) that turns Divan's human-only table into structured JSON and
diffs a run against a committed baseline. The goal is a fast, machine-readable
performance signal so that changes — whether made by a human or a coding agent —
get timely feedback.

## Quick start

```sh
just bench            # run all benches, write bench/results/latest.json
just bench-save main  # promote the latest run to the committed baseline
just bench-check      # run + diff vs baseline; non-zero exit on regression
```

Scope a run to one crate to iterate faster:

```sh
just bench -p talon-core
just bench-check -p talon-coordinator --threshold 15
```

## The workflow

1. **Establish a baseline.** On a known-good commit: `just bench && just bench-save main`.
   `bench/baselines/main.json` is committed and is the reference everything
   compares against.
2. **Iterate.** After a change, `just bench-check`. It prints a markdown table
   (`benchmark | baseline | current | Δ | verdict`) and exits non-zero if any
   benchmark regresses beyond the threshold (default ±10%, above typical
   microbench noise). Use `--soft` to report without failing.
3. **Intentional perf change?** Re-run `just bench-save main` to move the
   baseline, and commit it in the same PR so the diff is reviewable.

## What is measured

Deterministic, CPU-bound hot paths (low variance, good for regression
detection):

- `talon-core` (`core_benches`): key path ↔ id conversion, `PresentBitmap`
  operations, `BlockId::page_count`.
- `talon-coordinator` (`placement_benches`): `RendezvousPlacement::locate`
  across 8/64/256 nodes — the per-request placement lookup.

The zero-copy data plane (`sendfile`/`splice`) is I/O-bound and higher-variance;
those benches are added in a separate tier when the transport layer lands.

- `talon-worker` (`dataplane_benches`): the Tokio and io_uring data planes
  serving the same resident block over real loopback TCP (#285).

  **Read this one with care.** It drives a single client serially, so it
  measures a per-request latency floor, not scaling. At concurrency 1 the two
  planes are statistically indistinguishable — across seven runs the medians
  overlapped and the sign of the difference flipped run to run. That is
  expected: io_uring amortizes syscalls across many in-flight operations, and
  with one request in flight there is nothing to amortize, while the bulk bytes
  bypass the ring via `sendfile` on both paths. The 35% win measured in #273 was
  at 1024 concurrent connections.

  A Divan harness cannot model that concurrency honestly — a synthetic fan-out
  inside `bench()` would mostly measure the harness's own scheduling. So this
  bench is a **regression floor**, not the evidence for how the planes compare
  under load. That question is answered by the load test below.

## Concurrent load test

`scripts/dataplane_loadtest.sh` drives a real worker with many connections in
flight and reports the latency distribution. This is the measurement Divan
cannot make, and the evidence behind the io_uring default.

```sh
scripts/dataplane_loadtest.sh                        # sweep 1/64/256/1024
CONNS=1,512 SECONDS_PER=30 scripts/dataplane_loadtest.sh
```

It starts a coordinator, a local blob origin, and a worker on each data plane in
turn, then sweeps connection counts against each. Results on a 16-core EPYC
7763, 64 KiB ranges, 10 s measured after a 3 s warmup:

| conns | io_uring rps | tokio rps | io_uring p50 | tokio p50 | io_uring p99 | tokio p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5,636 | 4,837 | 161 µs | 191 µs | 259 µs | 293 µs |
| 64 | 54,755 | 55,191 | 900 µs | 1,057 µs | 5,371 µs | 2,853 µs |
| 256 | 42,417 | 56,999 | 1,243 µs | 3,835 µs | 7,423 µs | 10,283 µs |
| **1024** | **51,668** | 41,060 | **1,175 µs** | 19,905 µs | **4,781 µs** | 72,911 µs |

At 1024 connections io_uring delivers **26% more throughput at 17× lower p50 and
15× lower p99**, using comparable CPU and 19% less memory.

**The middle of the sweep is not monotonic, and that is worth knowing.** At 64
and 256 connections Tokio sometimes wins — work-stealing balances a moderate
load well, while rings can sit idle. The advantage becomes decisive at high
connection counts, which is the regime a cache fleet actually runs in. Do not
read a single row as the whole picture.

Notes on running it:

- **Manual, not CI.** Shared runners are too noisy for absolute-time
  comparison, the same reason the bench job is informational.
- **Percentiles, not means.** The difference lives in the tail; a mean hides it.
- **Warmup is excluded** from recorded samples, so the numbers describe the
  serve path rather than the first-fetch miss path.
- **`talon-loadgen` can drive an existing worker** directly:
  `talon-loadgen --addr host:7001 --backend s3 --conns 1024 --server-pid <pid>`.
  Set `--backend` to the backend configured on the target worker (the default is
  `az`). With `--server-pid` it samples the worker's CPU and RSS from `/proc`
  across the measured window; `--json` emits JSON Lines for scripted comparison.
- A run that reports **no samples** is a failed run, not a fast one — the tool
  refuses to turn error frames into latency numbers and prints the first error
  verbatim.

## Native-client path load test

`just client-path-bench` measures the public C ABI through a real coordinator,
worker, cache, and HTTP origin. The native load generator calls
`talon_stat_async` once before startup, then passes that exact `(version, size)`
to every `talon_read_async`. Callback completion immediately submits the next
read for that slot, so `--concurrency` means independent in-flight application
requests rather than blocks inside one artificial giant read.

```sh
# Fast build/startup/ABI/proxy check.
just client-path-bench smoke

# Individual full matrices, or all of them in sequence.
just client-path-bench hot
just client-path-bench latency
just client-path-bench backend
just client-path-bench failure
just client-path-bench membership
just client-path-bench all
```

Every measured object is 64 MiB and the client and worker block sizes remain at
the production default of 256 MiB. Request sizes are independently swept at
4 KiB, 64 KiB, and 1 MiB. The C load generator rejects a request at or above
256 MiB and checks every generated range before submission; every output summary
therefore records whether the workload remained below one block and whether all
ranges touched exactly one block. Multi-block fan-out is not used to explain
small-read QPS. Worker L1 is disabled in every scenario; L2 is paged at 1 MiB
with a 256 MiB byte-accounted capacity.

Workers run with `RUST_LOG=warn`. The normal INFO stream contains one line per
cache hit, which would turn a capacity run into tens of GiB of synchronous log
output and measure the log sink instead of the data path. WARN still preserves
unexpected worker failures, and the environment row records the filter.

The single-block assertion is about Talon's 256 MiB logical block boundary,
not the L2 page boundary. Offsets are 4 KiB aligned but otherwise random, so a
1 MiB range will usually touch two adjacent 1 MiB L2 pages; the emitted L2 miss
and backend-fetch counters intentionally include both pages.

The default matrices are:

- `hot`: direct worker, 3 s warmup, 10 s measurement, three repeats. 4 KiB and
  64 KiB use concurrency `1,8,32,64,128,256,512,1024`; 1 MiB stops at 256 so
  caller buffers alone do not exceed 256 MiB.
- `latency`: the same hot-cache matrix through the standalone Talon-frame proxy
  with `0,1,5,10 ms` response delay. The 0 ms arm quantifies proxy overhead and
  proxy results are never presented as the direct worker ceiling.
- `backend`: 1 MiB paged L2, 256 MiB capacity, a 1 GiB random working set, and
  worker backend delays of `0,5,20,50 ms`. These rows report worker CPU/RSS,
  L2 misses, and backend fetches separately from hot-cache rows.
- `failure`: a proxy baseline followed by typed `Unavailable` on every 100th
  attempt. The proxy preserves the original request id. Client logical errors,
  worker/proxy attempts, injected failures, membership queries, and throughput
  loss remain separate counters.
- `membership`: two real workers with worker/coordinator heartbeat 100 ms,
  unhealthy threshold 500 ms, and lease 1500 ms. The harness identifies the
  current object owner from worker request metrics, runs steadily for 5 s,
  kills that process, and emits one-second QPS/error buckets plus exclusion and
  first-survivor timing.

Raw JSON Lines go to `bench/results/c-client-latest.jsonl` (ignored by Git).
The environment row records both the base commit and whether the measured tree
was dirty. Each load row includes successful and logical-attempt QPS, MiB/s,
p50/p95/p99/p999/max, submission and logical errors, the first error, requested
and peak actual concurrency, and single-block assertions. Adjacent
`stack_metrics` rows contain worker attempts, cache misses, backend fetches,
membership queries, CPU/RSS, and proxy counters. Stack rates cover warmup plus
measurement; `worker_attempts` excludes the one startup stat while
`worker_requests_including_stat` retains the raw worker count. A loadgen
`attempt` is one public `talon_read_async` call. `proxy_attempts` is more
specifically the number of `GetVersionedRange` frames observed by the benchmark
proxy: it excludes the startup stat and includes any client retry frames. Thus,
in fault runs `retry_attempts` is the excess of proxy read-frame attempts over
logical calls, and `retry_succeeded` removes final logical failures from that
count. The summarizer reports median QPS and worst p99 across repeats:

```sh
python3 scripts/summarize_c_client_loadtest.py \
  bench/results/c-client-latest.jsonl
```

For shorter exploratory runs, all dimensions can be overridden without editing
the harness, for example:

```sh
TALON_C_BENCH_WARMUP_SECONDS=1 \
TALON_C_BENCH_MEASURE_SECONDS=3 \
TALON_C_BENCH_REPEATS=1 \
TALON_C_BENCH_SMALL_CONCURRENCY="32 128 512" \
just client-path-bench hot
```

`TALON_C_BENCH_L2_PAGE_SIZE` can override the 1 MiB page size for an explicit
comparison; setting it to `0` selects whole-block L2 and is not the default
capacity result.

10K successful reads/s is a product target to observe, not a hard-coded CI
threshold. If a machine misses it, compare connection count, CPU/RSS, worker
latency, proxy overhead, and backend counters before attributing the bottleneck.
Absolute results are host-specific and this manual benchmark never blocks a
merge.

## Object-store gateway

`just gateway-bench` measures the bounded HTTP runtime around controlled
cache-client, worker, and origin delays, then streams a large object to a slow
consumer while sampling RSS. Results and interpretation are in the
[gateway benchmark reference](docs/reference/object-store-gateway-benchmarks.md).
The harness emits JSON Lines and is a regression floor, not a cloud capacity
claim.

### S3 and Azure proxy paths, end to end

`just gateway-proxy-bench` drives the gateway's **real** adapters — a live
coordinator, worker, cache and origin — rather than the fixed sleeps above.
It exists to answer two questions the synthetic harness cannot: does either
client protocol cost more than the other, and what does the cache route buy
over passing through to origin?

Four deployments run concurrently on one 16-core host (S3 and Azure × `cache`
and `origin`), against one dual-protocol origin stub so both adapters face an
identical backend. Rounds are paired and **order-swapped**, so machine drift
lands on both arms instead of on whichever ran first. Every response is
verified against the origin by SHA-256; a wrong status, length, or checksum
fails the run rather than being counted as throughput.

| Arm | rps (median of 4) | MiB/s | p50 | p99 | CPU/req | cores busy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S3, `cache` | 3,080 | 3,080 | 1.64 ms | 3.64 ms | 840 µs | 2.98 |
| Azure, `cache` | 3,165 | 3,165 | 1.63 ms | 3.22 ms | 840 µs | 2.97 |
| S3, `origin` | 1,579 | 1,579 | 2.01 ms | 44.6 ms | 990 µs | 1.47 |
| Azure, `origin` | 1,638 | 1,638 | 1.95 ms | 45.0 ms | 975 µs | 1.72 |

1 MiB ranges, concurrency 8, 2,000 measured requests per arm per round, 64 MiB
object.

**The two protocols cost the same.** Azure leads S3 by 2.8% on the cache route,
but the run-to-run spread within a single arm is up to 4.0%, so that gap is
smaller than the noise it sits in. Per-request CPU is identical to three
significant figures (840 µs both). Treat S3 and Azure as equal-cost front
ends; there is no protocol-level reason to prefer one.

**The cache route is ~1.95× the origin route** and, more importantly, changes
the shape of the tail: p99 falls from ~45 ms to ~3.4 ms, a 13× improvement,
because a cache hit never inherits the origin's variance.

**Control, so the origin arms are not misread.** The same client straight to
the origin stub with the gateway removed reaches 4,014 rps. The origin arms
land near 40% of that, so they are measuring gateway passthrough cost, not the
stub's ceiling. They still hold the origin's latency distribution, which is why
their p99 is the stub's and not the gateway's.

**What this is not.** Loopback, one host, a synthetic origin: these are
*relative* numbers for comparing adapters and routes, not a cloud capacity
claim. Cross-node, the NIC binds long before any of these figures
([see below](#where-the-serve-path-actually-saturates)).

## Where the serve path actually saturates

The sweep above compares data planes against each other. It does not answer a
prior question: *what is the ceiling, and what is holding it?* These runs do.
They matter because an optimization that helps on loopback can be worth nothing
on a real cluster, where a different resource runs out first.

All numbers below: `talon-srv8` on a managed Kubernetes cluster
(`Standard_E64ads_v5` class node, worker capped at 8 CPU by its cgroup),
64 KiB ranges, all cache hits, 32 connections, 20 s measured after a 6 s
warmup, `talon-loadgen --depth 16`.

### Loopback: the kernel is the bottleneck, not Talon

Client and worker on the same node, over `127.0.0.1`:

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| throughput | 167,278 rps = **11.0 GB/s** (87.7 Gbps) |
| worker CPU | 5.78 of 8 cores |
| **kernel time** | **85% of worker CPU** (12,873 of 15,079 ticks) |
| user time | 15% (2,206 ticks) |

Tuning the ring count and connection count raises the peak further, on the same
8-core host, at depth 16 with 64 connections:

| rings | throughput | GB/s | worker CPU | kernel share |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 51,718 rps | 3.39 | 1.00 | 88% |
| 2 | 71,907 rps | 4.71 | 1.99 | 88% |
| 4 | 138,144 rps | 9.05 | 3.98 | 88% |
| **8** | **189,379 rps** | **12.41** | 5.71 | 89% |

189,379 rps reproduced within 1% across runs (187,553 on a repeat). Note that the
8-ring peak uses 5.71 of 8 cores: the system stops being CPU-bound before it runs
out of cores, because a single pipelined ring already spends 88% of its time in
the kernel and additional rings contend for one shared network stack.

![Throughput and CPU used across 1, 2, 4 and 8 io_uring rings](docs/assets/bench/ring-scaling.svg)

CPU was sampled from `utime`/`stime` in `/proc/<pid>/stat` across the measured
window. The split is the finding: **six sevenths of the worker's CPU is spent
inside the kernel** — `sendfile` copying bytes and the TCP stack — and only one
seventh in Talon's own code (frame decode, cache lookup, response assembly).

![Worker CPU split: 85% kernel time, 15% Talon's own code](docs/assets/bench/cpu-split.svg)

The practical consequence is that user-space optimizations on this path have a
small denominator. Halving *all* of Talon's user-space work on the serve path
would move total CPU by about 7%. Work that removes copies or syscalls
(zero-copy send, batched submission) acts on the 85%.

### Across the network: the NIC is the bottleneck, and it binds first

Same worker, driven from `talon-cli7-0` on a **different node**, over the pod
network:

| path | rps | GB/s | Gbps | p50 | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| loopback | 167,278 | 11.0 | 87.7 | 4,617 µs | 35,244 µs |
| **cross-node** | **44,662** | **2.93** | **23.4** | 20,269 µs | 49,905 µs |

Cross-node throughput is **27% of the loopback rate at the same 32 connections**
(24% of the 189,379 rps peak reached at 64 connections), and 23.4 Gbps against a
25 GbE link is the wire, saturated. On this cluster the NIC runs out well before
the worker does — the worker is not the constraint at all.

![Loopback vs cross-node throughput against the 25 GbE line rate](docs/assets/bench/throughput-ceilings.svg)

**Read the loopback number as a component ceiling, not a capacity claim.** It
measures how fast the serve path can go when the network is free. Any change
that moves the loopback number but not the cross-node number has not made the
deployed system faster.

### Pipelining: the one change that moved the network number

Depth is requests kept in flight per connection (`--depth`). Cross-node:

| depth | rps | GB/s | p50 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 22,315 | 1.46 | 762 µs |
| **16** | **44,592** | **2.92** | 20,250 µs |

Pipelining **doubles cross-node throughput**, because at depth 1 each connection
pays a full network round trip per request and the link sits idle waiting. It
buys throughput with latency: p50 rises 27×, as depth-16 queueing means a
request waits behind 15 others. That is the expected trade, not a defect —
depth 1 is latency-optimal, depth 16 is bandwidth-optimal.

### Multiplexing: measured, and not merged

Serving a connection's requests concurrently with out-of-order replies
(multiplexing, as opposed to in-order pipelining) was implemented and measured
against the same baseline. It did not pay:

| | baseline | multiplexed | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| loopback rps | 167,278 | 160,725 | **−3.9%** |
| loopback user ticks | 2,206 | 2,484 | **+12.6%** |
| loopback kernel ticks | 12,873 | 12,895 | +0.2% |
| loopback max latency | 51.7 ms | **5,111 ms** | 99× worse |
| cross-node rps | 44,662 | 44,612 | −0.1% |

The kernel time is unchanged — multiplexing does not remove a single copy or
syscall — while user time rises by an eighth for task spawning, semaphore
admission, and write-lock acquisition. Multiplexing exists to remove head-of-line
blocking, which requires *variance* in per-request service time; a uniform
all-cache-hit workload has none to remove, so only the overhead lands.

The max-latency blowup is structural and worth recording. Two responses' bytes
must never interleave on the wire, and `sendfile` cannot be paused mid-transfer,
so the write half must be held exclusively for the duration of each response.
Multiplexing therefore reintroduces at the writer exactly the serialization it
removes at the reader — and adds lock queueing on top.

Cross-node the two are indistinguishable, because there the NIC decides.

**Conclusion: not merged.** Multiplexing may still pay on a workload with genuine
service-time variance (mixed cache hits and origin misses on one connection),
which is the condition to test before revisiting it. It does not pay here.

### Method notes

- **Paired and order-swapped.** Baseline and candidate were run alternately, and
  the order reversed between rounds, so drift in the shared cluster cannot
  masquerade as an effect.
- **Baselines built from the exact parent commit**, not from a nearby branch.
  Comparing against a tree that already contains another change produces a
  confident and wrong number; this was caught happening.
- **The measurement client can be the bottleneck.** An earlier version of
  `talon-loadgen` matched pipelined replies positionally, which serialized its
  own reader and capped every depth-16 result near 85k rps — half the true
  figure. Numbers recorded before that fix understate the worker and should not
  be compared against numbers here. When a candidate and its baseline both sit
  at a suspiciously equal ceiling, suspect the harness.

## Charts

The figures above are generated, not hand-drawn. `bench/data/dataplane.json`
holds the measurements and is the single source of truth for both the charts and
the tables on this page; `scripts/bench_charts.py` renders it to SVG:

```sh
just bench-charts           # re-render docs/assets/bench/*.svg
just bench-charts --check   # non-zero exit if a chart is stale
```

Dependencies are declared inline (PEP 723), so `uv` builds a throwaway
environment on demand — there is nothing to install and matplotlib is not a
project dependency.

**To record a new measurement, edit the JSON and re-run — never edit an SVG.**
Keeping one source means a re-measurement cannot leave the charts saying one
thing and the prose another. Output is byte-reproducible (fixed `svg.hashsalt`,
no render timestamp), so an unchanged run produces no diff and `--check` is
meaningful. `--check` renders to a scratch directory rather than the committed
paths, so it reports drift instead of silently repairing it.

## For coding agents

- One command surface: `just bench`, `just bench-save`, `just bench-check`,
  `just bench-charts`.
- `bench-check` output is a markdown table and its exit code is the verdict
  (0 = within threshold, 1 = regression). Parse either.
- `bench/results/latest.json` and `bench/baselines/<name>.json` are stable
  `{ "binary::name[/arg]": median_ns }` maps for programmatic diffing.
- `bench/data/dataplane.json` is the structured record of the data-plane
  measurements — read numbers from there rather than parsing prose or SVGs.
- Prefer scoping with `-p <crate>` while iterating; run the full suite before
  saving a baseline.

## CI

The `bench` CI job runs `bench-check --soft` and posts the table to the job
summary. It is **informational only** (`continue-on-error`) — shared CI runners
are too noisy for absolute-time gating, so benchmarks never block a merge. The
committed baseline is the source of truth; refresh it deliberately.
